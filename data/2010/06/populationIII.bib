	Abstract = {I review some recent progress made in our understanding of galaxy evolution and the cosmic history of star formation. Like bookends, the results obtained from deep ground-based spectroscopy and from the Hubble Deep Field imaging survey put brackets around the intermediate redshift interval, $1<z<2$, where starbirth probably peaked at a rate 10 times higher than today. The steady decline observed since $z\sim 1$ is largely associated with late-type galaxies. At $z\gtrsim 2.5$, the Lyman-break selected objects may represent the precursors of present-day spheroids, but appear, on average, quite underluminous relative to the expectations of the standard early-and-rapidly forming picture for spheroidal systems. The observed ultraviolet light density accounts for the bulk of the metals seen today in ``normal'' massive galaxies.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT The first generation of stars to form in the universe may have been very massive, and, due to the absence of initial metals, they could have retained most of their mass until their death and thus explode as pair instability supernovae. These supernovae encounter the late burning phases beyond carbon burning in an implosive&sol;explosive way, leading to very powerful thermonuclear-powered explosions, up to a hundred times more powerful than ordinary supernovae. For primordial stars, these explosions also produce a peculiar abundance pattern, showing a strong odd-even pattern in the elemental abundances, a sharp drop-off of nucleosynthetic production beyond the iron group, and no r-process contribution. These results are greatly altered if only a small mass of 14N is dredged down into the helium burning core before the star becomes unstable. Such mixing could be a consequence of differential rotation or convective overshooting. },

	Abstract = {We use cosmological simulations to study the origin of primordial star-forming clouds in a ΛCDM universe, by following the formation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. To model the physics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a nonequilibrium treatment of the chemistry of nine species ( e − , H, H + , He, He + , He ++ , H 2 , H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/592/2/645/img1.gif] {img1.gif} , H − ) and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. By considering cosmological volumes, we are able to study the statistical properties of primordial halos, and the high resolution of our simulations enables us to examine these objects in detail. In particular, we explore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/approx.gif] {approx} 25-30 with total masses in the range ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/approx.gif] {approx} 10 5 -10 6 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} . We find that when the amount of molecular hydrogen in these objects reaches a critical level, cooling by rotational line emission is efficient, and dense clumps of cold gas form. We identify these "gas clouds" as sites for primordial star formation. In our simulations, the threshold for gas cloud formation by molecular cooling corresponds to a critical halo mass of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/approx.gif] {approx} 5 × 10 5 h -1 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} , in agreement with earlier estimates, but with a weak dependence on redshift in the range z > 16. The complex interplay between the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of the critical H 2 fraction. Dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposes relatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the production of star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. We also investigate the effect of photodissociating ultraviolet radiation on the formation of primordial gas clouds. We consider two extreme cases, first by including a uniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and second by accounting for the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions. For radiation with Lyman-Werner band flux J > 10 -23 ergs s -1 cm -2 Hz -1 sr -1 , hydrogen molecules are rapidly dissociated, rendering gas cooling inefficient. In both the cases we consider, the overall effect can be described by computing an equilibrium H 2 abundance for the radiation flux and defining an effective shielding factor. Based on our numerical results, we develop a semianalytic model of the formation of the first stars and demonstrate how it can be coupled with large N -body simulations to predict the star formation rate in the early universe.},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the metal contents of Lyman-alpha clouds at 2.2<z<3.6 with 10^13.5<N(HI)<10^14 cm-2 using high resolution, high S/N spectra of 9 quasars obtained with the 10m Keck I telescope. Using an composite spectrum analysis technique, we deduce a mean metallicity of [C/H]<-3.5 for such clouds, which is a factor of more than 10 less than that inferred for Lyman-alpha clouds with N(HI)>10^14.5 cm-2. This result rules out the suggestion that a generation of Population III stars could have polluted the entire universe to a (nearly) uniform metallicity level of [C/H]=-2.5. Cosmological simulations involving gas hydrodynamics indicate that Lyman-alpha absorption with N(HI)>10^14.5 cm-2 mostly occur in the filamentary gaseous regions surrounding and connecting collapsed objects, while those with N(HI)<10^14 cm-2 are preferentially found in void regions further away from collapsed objects. These results, coupled with the simulation results of Ostriker and Gnedin (1996) and Gnedin and Ostriker (1997) for Pop III star formation and enrichment, strongly suggest that most of the heavy elements in Lyman-alpha clouds with N(HI)>10^14.5 cm-2 (i.e., gas in the filaments) were probably prodcued in situ by Pop II stars, in the sense that they were either made by stars within the clouds or were ejected from nearby star-forming galaxies. Within this context, clouds with N(HI)<10^14 cm-2 (i.e., gas in void regions) may only have e experienced pollution from Pop III stars.},
